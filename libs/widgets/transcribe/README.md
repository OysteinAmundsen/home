# widgets/transcribe

An experiment using the Whisper AI model as a server side python script. The widget uses media inputs to record audio, or file inputs to upload audio files. The server side will process the given file through the whisper ai model and return the textual output of the model. No files are stored on the server, it all happens in memory.
