Dashboard app testing Angular 19 features using custom API from SSR server and lazy-loaded and lazy-rendered components.

The app features:

- BFF [NestJS powered api](./apps/home/server.ts)
- Workbox service-worker built into the dev process. Works on both `build` and `serve`.

This is my feature playground. Nothing useful here, just me playing around.
